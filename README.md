## About 

This is a placeholder for projet that implements a RAG system to find xkcd comics relevant to a query string.

The technique would apply in the first instance to image embeddings (i.e. semantic search on image meaning). 

However, it is expected (hypothesis) that the technique would work better using the textual version of "XKCD explained". 
It would an entirely parallel RAG system on embeddings of those text descriptions. 

Potentially, the two streams could be married together in order to improve the search capability of either in isolation.
